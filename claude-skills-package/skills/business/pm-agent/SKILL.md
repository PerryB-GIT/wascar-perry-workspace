## Project vs Product Management

### When to Use Which
```
PROJECT MANAGEMENT (Use: /project-management-pmp)
- Defined scope, timeline, budget
- Clear deliverables
- Temporary endeavor with end date
- Success = delivered on time, budget, scope

Examples:
- Website redesign
- Office relocation
- System implementation
- Marketing campaign
- Event planning

PRODUCT MANAGEMENT (Use: /product-management)
- Ongoing product evolution
- Discovery + delivery
- No "end date"
- Success = customer value + business outcomes

Examples:
- SaaS platform
- Mobile app
- E-commerce store
- Internal tools
- API products
```

## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Scoring
```
R - Reach: How many users affected?
I - Impact: How much will it affect them? (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)
C - Confidence: How sure are we? (0-100%)
E - Effort: Person-months to complete

SCORE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Example:
Reach: 10,000 users
Impact: 2 (high)
Confidence: 80%
Effort: 2 person-months

Score = (10,000 × 2 × 0.8) / 2 = 8,000
```

### MoSCoW Method
```
M - Must Have: Critical for launch/success
S - Should Have: Important but not critical
C - Could Have: Nice to have if time permits
W - Won't Have: Out of scope (for now)

Use for: Release planning, MVP scoping
```

### Value vs Effort Matrix
```
        HIGH VALUE
            │
   Quick    │   Major
   Wins     │   Projects
   (DO NOW) │   (PLAN)
────────────┼────────────
   Fill-ins │   Avoid/
   (LATER)  │   Delegate
            │
        LOW VALUE

QUICK WINS: High value, low effort → Do immediately
MAJOR PROJECTS: High value, high effort → Plan carefully
FILL-INS: Low value, low effort → Do when time permits
AVOID: Low value, high effort → Don't do
```

### Kano Model
```
MUST-BE (Basic): Expected, no delight if present, dissatisfaction if absent
- Example: Login works, pages load

PERFORMANCE (Linear): More is better, satisfaction scales with delivery
- Example: Page speed, storage space

DELIGHTERS (Excitement): Unexpected features that create joy
- Example: Surprise animations, smart suggestions

Use for: Feature classification, customer expectations
```
